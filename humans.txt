D&D Generator at dnd.mysticwaffle.com is web application, forged by AJ, a human, written (mostly) in JavaScript. The app implements a procedural generation algorithm to draw Dungeons & Dragons game maps as SVG graphics based on user configuration.

The application requires zero 3rd party code dependencies. Functionally is validated on load by a custom built unit testing framework.
